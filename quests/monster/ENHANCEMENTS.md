# Monster Module ‚Äî Enhancement Ideas

Quick brainstorm of extensions and polish items for future caretakers:

- **Richer HUD**: evolve the current toolbar into a full prompt_toolkit layout (panels for stats, quest progress, inventory tables) with coloured bars and progress meters.
- **Notification Channels**: add optional netlink/eventfd hooks so tooling can subscribe to lifecycle/quest events without parsing the main stream.
- **Replay / Telemetry**: pipe structured events (JSON or binary) to debugfs or relayfs so you can replay a session or analyse metrics offline.
- **Advanced client UX**: add log category tabs, mouse support, a collapsible quest sidebar, and export-to-markdown summaries for teaching sessions.
- **Educational overlays**: tie lifecycle events to kernel concepts (e.g., show which kernel APIs were exercised) so learners see cause/effect.
