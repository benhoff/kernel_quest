# Monster Module — Enhancement Ideas

Quick brainstorm of extensions and polish items for future caretakers:

- **Interactive HUD**: replace raw text with a prompt_toolkit layout that shows stats, quest progress, and inventory tables. Colour-code stability/hunger and surface lifecycle progress visually.
- **Notification Channels**: add optional netlink/eventfd hooks so tooling can subscribe to lifecycle/quest events without parsing the main stream.
- **Replay / Telemetry**: pipe structured events (JSON or binary) to debugfs or relayfs so you can replay a session or analyse metrics offline.
- **Educational overlays**: tie lifecycle events to kernel concepts (e.g., show which kernel APIs were exercised) so learners see cause/effect.
